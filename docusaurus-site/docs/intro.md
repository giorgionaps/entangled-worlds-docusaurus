# Welcome to Entangled Worlds & My Portfolio

This site serves two purposes:

- **Documentation Hub for Entangled Worlds (Noita Mod)**
Find installation guides and release notes for the Entangled Worlds mod. 

- **Technical Writing Portfolio**
Alongside the mod docs, this site showcases selected writing samples. It demonstrates my experience using a docs-as-code approach with tools like Docusaurus, Git, and version-controlled workflows.

# Who this site is for

**Players:** Get started quickly with the mod and troubleshoot common issues.
**Hiring Managers & Colleagues:** Explore writing samples and see how I approach clarity, structure, and user-friendly documentation.
